## Introduction

<!--

- our objective is to construct forecasts based on time series models

- time series models try to uncover the link between past and present - the time dependence in the data

- time dependence is the key to predicting future values of the variable of interest: future depends on present in a similar way that present depends on the past


## Introduction
-->

- before constructing a forecast based on a time series model, forecaster needs to decide about three basic elements that guide the production of the forecast
    1. **Information set**
    2. **Forecast horizon**
    3. **Loss function**
    
- information set will be used to construct conditional density function to be able to evaluate expectations, and the optimal forecast will minimize the expected loss

## Introduction

example: to forecast the number of new homes built, we need to

(1) construct the **information set** 
    - gather relevant up-to-date information for the problem at hand - existing number of houses, state of the local economy, population inflows, ... 
    - this information is used to estimate the time series model and construct the forecast

(2) choose **forecast horizon**: how far into the future to forecast
    - 1-month-ahead, 1-quarter-ahead, 1-year-ahead, 10-years-ahead, ...
    - this depends on the use of the forecast
        - e.g. a policy makers who plans to design or revamp the transportation services of the area or any other infrastructure is likely to be more interested in long-term predictions of new housing (1 year, 2 years, 5 years) than in short-term predictions (1 month, 1 quarter)
    - forecast horizon influences the choice of the frequency of the time series data 
        - e.g. if our interest is a 1-month-ahead prediction, we may wish to collect monthly data, or if our interest is a 1-day-ahead forecast, we may collect daily data

(3) decide which **loss function** best represents the costs associated with forecast errors
    - forecast errors will happen and more importantly they will be costly
    - costs of underestimation and of overestimation may be of different magnitude
    - we  will choose a forecast that minimizes the expected loss



## 4.1 Information Set

- a **univariate information set** is the historical time series of the process up to time $t$
$$
    I_t = \{y_0, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_t\}
$$
- a **multivariate information set** is the collection of several historical time series
$$
    I_t = \{y_0, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_t, x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_t, z_0, z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_t\}
$$
- for example, to produce a 1-year-ahead forecast for new houses built
    - univariate information set is the time series of new houses built in previous years 
    - multivariate information set may in addition contain the time series for inflows of population, unemployment in the area, ...



## 4.1 Information Set

- forecast $f_{t,h}$ is constructed as a function of the information set
$$
    f_{t,h} = g(I_t)
$$
function $g(\cdot)$ represents the time series model that processes the known information up to time $t$ and from which we produce the forecast of the variable of interest at a future date $t + h$



## 4.1 Information Set

- some examples of 1-step-ahead forecasts of a process $\{Y_t\}$
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{(i)} & \quad f_{t,1} = 0.8 y_t \\
    \text{(ii)} & \quad f_{t,1} = 0.2 y_t - 0.9 y_{t-1} \\
    \text{(iii)} & \quad f_{t,1} = \frac{4}{1+0.5 y_t} \\
    \text{(iv)} & \quad f_{t,1} = 1.8 y_t - 0.5 y_{t-1} + 0.4 x_t + 0.3 x_{t-1} + 0.6 x_{t-2}
\end{aligned}
$$
- in (i), (ii) and (iii) the information set is univariate, in (iv) it is multivariate



## 4.1 Information Set

- predictability of a time series depends on how useful the information set is

- sometimes univariate information sets are not very helpful, and we need to resort to multivariate information sets

- for example, stock returns are very difficult to predict on the basis of past stock returns alone, but when we add other information such as firm size, price-earnings ratio, cash flows, and so on, we find some predictability

- some time series (e.g. stock returns, interest rates, exchange rates, ...) are inherently very difficult to predict due to
    - lack of understanding of the phenomenon
    - lack of statistical methods
    - high uncertainty making it difficult to separate information from noise 

<!--
- note: in some cases transformation can help., e.g. financial returns $R_t$ are difficult to predict, but squared returns $R^2_t$ and absolute returns $|R_t|$ are more predictable

- these two transformations also have economic meaning because both speak about the volatility of returns, which is of interest to economists, investors, government agencies
-->



## 4.2 Forecast Horizon

- we distinguish between a **short-term** forecast and a **long-term** forecast

- in economics up to a 1-year-ahead prediction is a short-term forecast, forecasts between 1 and 10 years are considered short/medium term or medium/long term, and a 10-year-ahead and longer prediction is a long-term forecast

- short-, medium-, and long-term forecast are functions of the frequency of the data and of the properties of the model

- we distinguish between **1-step ahead forecast** $f_{t,1}$ and **multistep forecast** $f_{t,h}$ for $h > 1$



<!--

## 4.2 Forecast Horizon

note that both one-step and multistep forecasts can be short-term and long-term:

\medskip

low-frequency time series data sampled at long periods of time: 

- e.g. census data collected at 10-year intervals

- 1-step-ahead prediction is a 10-year-ahead prediction 

- this a long-term predictions even though its only 1 step ahead forecast


high-frequency time series data sampled at short intervals of time

- e.g. with financial data collected at daily, 5 minutes, or 1 second frequency, a multistep forecast would refer to a short run prediction 

- with daily data, a 30-step-ahead forecast is 1-month-ahead prediction, and with 5 minutes data, a 60-step-ahead forecast is 1-hour-ahead prediction 

- both are short term forecasts even though they are multistep forecasts

\medskip

if we need a long-term forecast, there are two ways to go

(1) choose a time series with the same frequency as the forecast horizon 
(2) choose high-frequency data to produce a low-frequency forecast



## 4.2 Forecast Horizon

- example: if the goal is to forecast the monthly change in prices we can
     (i) use monthly series to produce 1-step-ahead forecast
    (ii) use weekly series and aggregate over the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-step-ahead forecasts

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip, width=6cm]{figures/rivera/fig4_0.png}
    \end{figure}

- in (i) to predict $\Delta p_{t+1}^m = p_{t+1}^m - p_t^m$ we need the 1-step-ahead forecast $f^m_{t,1}$ 
    
- in (ii) since
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta p_{t+1}^m 
            &= p_{t+1}^m - p_t+^m = p_{t_4}^w - p_{t_0}^w \\
            &= (p_{t_4}^w - p_{t_3}^w) + (p_{t_3}^w - p_{t_2}^w) + (p_{t_2}^w - p_{t_1}^w) + (p_{t_1}^w- p_{t_0}^w) \\
            &= \Delta p_{t_4}^w + \Delta p_{t_3}^w + \Delta p_{t_2}^w + \Delta p_{t_1}^w
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    we need to compute the 1-,2-,3-, and 4-step-ahead forecast to predict $\Delta p_{t+1}^m$ as
    $$  
        \tilde f_{t,1}^m = f_{t_0,4}^w + f_{t_0,3}^w + f_{t_0,2}^w + f_{t_0,1}^w
    $$



## 4.2 Forecast Horizon

- in general the above two forecast $f^m_{t,1}$ and $\tilde f_{t,1}^m$ will not be same - functional form of the best time series models for low-frequency data and for high-frequency data will not be same, even though we are modeling the same variables

- general recommendation: use the same data frequency as the forecast horizon of interest 

- that is, if you need a monthly forecast, model monthly time series and construct 1-step-ahead forecast

-->


## 4.2.1 Forecasting Environments

**(how to avoid backing the wrong horse)**

- suppose that we have a time series with $T$ observations, $\{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_T\}$

- we divide the sample into two parts: **estimation sample** and **prediction sample**

- estimate the model using observations in estimation sample, with $t < T$ observations, $\{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_t\}$

- we then assess the performance of models in-sample and out-of-sample

- **in-sample assessment** - evaluate goodness of the model (perform specification tests) using observations from 1 to $t$

- **out-of-sample assessment** - evaluate the forecasting ability of the model using observations from $t+1$ to $T$

    - e.g. if we are interested in evaluating accuracy of 1-step-ahead forecasts we first produce a sequence of out-of-sample 1-step-ahead forecasts $f_{t+j,1}$ where $j = 0, 1, \ldots T-t-1$ for $\{Y_{t+1}, Y_{t+2}, \ldots,Y_T\}$
    - we next compute a sequence of 1-step-ahead forecast errors $e_{t+j,1} = y_{t+j+1} - f_{t+j,1}$ for $j = 0, 1, \ldots, T-t-1$ 
    - finally, we assess the accuracy of the forecast by plugging the forecast errors into the loss function and calculating the average or  the maximum loss



## 4.2.1 Forecasting Environments

- three forecasting schemes: **recursive**, **rolling**, and **fixed**



## 4.2.1 Forecasting Environments

**recursive forecasting scheme**  

- repeatedly increase estimation sample by one observation, reestimate the model with extra observation, and compute a 1-step ahead forecast  
- estimation sample keeps expanding until the prediction sample is exhausted
- this yields a sequence of 1-step-ahead forecasting errors $\{e_{t,1}, e_{t+1,1},\ldots e_{T-1,1}\}$
- forecast errors are then used to calculate measures of forecast accuracy based on the loss function



## 4.2.1 Forecasting Environments

**recursive forecasting scheme** 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip, width=9cm]{figures/rivera/fig4_1.png}
\end{figure}



## 4.2.1 Forecasting Environments

**rolling forecasting scheme** 

- similar to recursive scheme  but estimation sample always contains the same number of observations
- thus at $t$ it contains observations 1 to $t$, at  $t+1$ observations 2 to $t + 1$, at time $t + 2$ observations 3 to $t + 2$, ...
- model is reestimated for each rolling sample, and 1-step-ahead forecast is produced 
- estimation sample is rolling until the prediction sample is exhausted
- this yields collection of 1-step-ahead forecasting errors $\{e_{t,1}, e_{t+1,1}, \ldots, e_{T-1,1}\}$
- forecast errors are then used to calculate measures of forecast accuracy based on the loss function



## 4.2.1 Forecasting Environments

**rolling forecasting scheme** 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip, width=9cm]{figures/rivera/fig4_2.png}
\end{figure}



## 4.2.1 Forecasting Environments

**fixed forecasting scheme** 
 
- model is estimated only once using the estimation sample that contains the first $t$ observations
- information set is updated but model is not reestimated - each one step ahead forecast is thus constructed using
same parameters
- for instance, at time $t+1$, information set contains one more observation, which will contribute to the construction of the 1-step-ahead forecast but will not be used to reestimate model parameters
- information set is updated until the prediction sample is exhausted
- this again yields collection of 1-step-ahead forecasting errors $\{e_{t,1}, e_{t+1,1},\ldots,e_{T-1,1}\}$
- forecast errors are then used to calculate measures of forecast accuracy based on the loss function



## 4.2.1 Forecasting Environments

**fixed forecasting scheme** 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip, width=9cm]{figures/rivera/fig4_3.png}
\end{figure}



## 4.2.1 Forecasting Environments

advantages and disadvantages of the three schemes

 - recursive scheme 
    - incorporates as much information as possible in the estimation of the model
    - advantageous if the model is stable over time
    - if the data have structural breaks, model's stability is in jeopardy and so is the forecast
 - rolling scheme 
    - avoids the potential problem with the model's stability
    - more robust against structural breaks in the data
    - does not make use of all the data
 - fixed scheme 
    - fast and convenient because - there is one and only one estimation
    - does not allow for parameter updating, so again problem with structural breaks and model's stability



<!--
## 4.2.1 Forecasting Environments

- in EViews fixed scheme is implemented a "Static forecast" option under **Proc $\rightarrow$ Forecast** 
-->



## 4.3 Loss function

what the best forecast is depends on the purpose of the forecast, its intended use

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip, width=8cm]{figures/alice2.jpg}
\end{figure}



## 4.3 Loss function

- example: suppose you live in Riverside, CA about 90 miles east of Los Angeles 
- you are departing on a business trip from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to meet with a client in New York
- you need to forecast how many hours it takes to get from Riverside to LAX
- information set $I_t$ will contain the distance between Riverside and LAX, rush hours in the area highways, construction work in the area, time needed for check-in at LAX, time needed for security check at LAX
- suppose the actual time could be either 5 hours or 3 hours with equal probability
- suppose your forecast is the average time needed $f_{t,1} = E(Y_{t+1}|I_t) = 4$ hours

$$
    f_{t,1} = 4 \qquad y_{t+1} 
    = \Big\{
    \begin{aligned}
        3 \\
        5
    \end{aligned}
    \quad
    \Rightarrow
    \quad
    e_{t,1} = y_{t+1} - f_{t,1}
    = \Big\{
    \begin{aligned}
        1 \\
        -1
    \end{aligned}
$$



## 4.3 Loss function

- suppose that it takes 5 hours to get to LAX and so you miss your flight

- the forecast error is $e_{t,1} = 1$ and the potential costs associated with it are

    - need to wait at the airport to hope to be able to get on the next flight
    - alternatively, purchase another ticket with a different airline
    - need to spend extra money on food, hotel
    - stressed and/or in bad mood for the rest of the day
    - professional reputation might be damaged if you miss the meeting with your client
    - prospective business deal might be lost
    
\medskip

- suppose that it takes 3 hours to get to LAX and you thus and an hour spare at LAX

- the forecast error is $e_{t,1} = -1$ and the potential costs associated with it are

    - having to wait in a noisy environment, uncomfortable chairs, crowded space, ...



## 4.3 Loss function

- note that positive and negative errors are of same magnitude, but costs are not

- your loss function is thus asymmetric

- taking into account your loss function, you decide that it makes sense for you to change your forecast and instead of average time $f_{t,1} = 4$ choose the maximum time thus $f_{t,1} = 5$ hours

- **as this example illustrates, the forecast will depend on the loss function that the forecaster is facing**

- the forecaster thus must know the loss function *before* making the forecast

- note also that in the example if you are avoiding positive forecast errors and always arrive at airport too early, the average forecast errors will be negative, not zero

- **it is rational to consistently make biased forecasts if loss function is asymmetric**


## 4.3 Loss function

- **loss function** $L(e_{t,h})$ is the evaluation of costs associated with the forecast error

- three properties that loss functions need to satisfy

i. if the forecast error is zero, the loss is zero:  
    $L(e_{t,h}) = 0$ when $e_{t,h} = 0$
ii. loss function is a non-negative function with minimum value equal to zero:  
    $L(e_{t,h}) \geq 0$ for all $e_{t,h}$ 
iii. for positive errors the loss is monotonically increasing, for negative errors it is monotonically decreasing:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{if} \quad e^{(1)}_{t,h} > e^{(2)}_{t,h} > 0 \quad\text{ then }\quad L(e^{(1)}_{t,h}) > L(e^{(2)}_{t,h}) \\
    \text{if} \quad e^{(1)}_{t,h} < e^{(2)}_{t,h} < 0 \quad\text{ then }\quad L(e^{(1)}_{t,h}) > L(e^{(2)}_{t,h})
\end{aligned}
$$ 



## 4.3.1 Some Examples of Loss Functions

**Symmetric Loss Functions**

- sign of the forecast errors is irrelevant, positive or negative errors of the same magnitude have identical costs

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip, width=8cm]{figures/rivera/fig4_4.png}
\end{figure}



## 4.3.1 Some Examples of Loss Functions

**Asymmetric Loss Functions**

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip, width=8cm]{figures/rivera/fig4_5.png}
\end{figure}



## 4.3.1 Some Examples of Loss Functions

- quadratic loss function is the most prevalent in practice - it is mathematically tractable

- most of the time, however economic agents have asymmetric loss functions
    - example with trip to LAX airport - for most people it is less costly to wait at the airport than to miss a flight
    - government planning spending and forecasting tax revenues - deficit and surplus of the same size are not viewed the same by most politicians
    - Fed policymakers deciding about interest rate, facing inflation vs unemployment tradeoff - monetary hawks and inflation doves 
    - investment fund managers making predictions of asset returns in their portfolio - underperforming by 5\% vs overperforming 5\% 
    - financial intermediaries are requited to make capital provisions as a preventive measure against insolvency caused by loan defaults



## 4.3.3 Optimal Forecast: An Introduction

- we now put all three components together - information set $I_t$, forecast horizon $h$, and loss function $L(e_{t,h})$

- recall: $e_{t,h} = y_{t+h}-f_{t,h}$ and $y_{t+h}$ is future value unknown at time $t$, of random variable $Y_{t+h}$, which has a conditional probability density function $f(y_{t+h}|I_t)$
 
 - because the loss function depends on a random variable, it is also a random variable, thus we can write the expected loss as
$$
    E(L(y_{t+h}-f_{t,h})) = \int L(y_{t+h}-f_{t,h}) f(y_{t+h}|I_t) d y_{t,h}
$$
- the optimal forecast is $f_{t,h}$ which minimizes the above expected loss 
$$
    \min_{f_{t,h}} E(L(y_{t+h}-f_{t,h}))
$$



## 4.3.3 Optimal Forecast: An Introduction

- if the loss function is quadratic, the optimal forecast that is minimizing the expected loss is
$$
    f_{t,h}^* = \mu_{t+h|t} = E(y_{t+h}|I_t) = \int y_{t+h} f(y_{t+h}|I_t) d y_{t,h}
$$

- we will discuss the optimal forecast under various symmetric and asymmetric loss function in more detail when we get to Chapter 9
