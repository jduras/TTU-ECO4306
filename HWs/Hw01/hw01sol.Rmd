## Problem 1 (50 points)

<!--
Download time series for U.S. Real GDP quarter-over-quarter growth rate, series code `A191RL1Q225SBEA` in the FRED database [http://fred.stlouisfed.org/](http://fred.stlouisfed.org/). Download the time series for Standard & Poor's 500 Index close price from Yahoo Finance database `YAHOO` at Quandl, [https://www,quandl.com/data/YAHOO](https://www,quandl.com/data/YAHOO), series code `INDEX_GSPC`. Import both time series into EViews into a same quarterly workfile. 

(a) Construct new time series in EViews for the S\&P 500 index return using
$$
    return_t = 100 \times \frac{index_t - index_{t-1}}{index_{t-1}} 
$$
(b) For both series, obtain their descriptive statistics - mean, median, variance, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis, histograms. 
(c) Examine the histograms and the Jarque-Bera statistic; are these random variables normally distributed? 
(d) Create a scatter plot and calculate the correlation coefficient. Are these two series contemporaneously correlated?

(a) (10 points) Figure below shows the time series plots for the two time series for the sample 1947Q2-2018Q3.

\end{center}

(c) (10 points) The high Jarque-Bera statistics and the associated p-value which are essentially zero imply that these two time series are not normally distributed. 

(d) (10 points) The scatter plot below suggests that there is only very weak contemporaneous correlation in the 1947Q2-2018Q3 sample, which is confirmed by calculating the correlation coefficient, $corr(gRGDP_t, rSP500_t) = 0.150$.

## Problem 2 (50 points)

<!--
Use the data for GDP growth rate and S\&P 500 return from Problem 2 to solve Exercise 3 from Chapter 2.

The stock market is said to be a leading indicator for GDP growth. Because the stock market prices the expectations of future earnings, a bullish market may predict future economic growth and vice versa. Let $Y_t$ be GDP growth rate and $X_t$ be S\&P 500 Index returns. (both series collected at the quarterly frequency as in the previous exercise). Run OLS for the following models:

a. contemporaneous correlation model: $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_t + u_t$ ()
b. one-quarter leading indicator model: $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{t-1} + u_t$
c. four-quarter leading indicator model: $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{t-1} + \beta_2 X_{t-2} + \beta_3 X_{t-3} + \beta_4 X_{t-4} + u_t$
d. leading indicator with GDP inertia: $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{t-1} + \beta_2 X_{t-2} + \beta_3 X_{t-3} + \beta_4 X_{t-4} + \beta_5 Y_{t-1} + u_t$

For each model, assess the R-squared and the adjusted R-squared. Which model is preferred?

*Solution*

Below are the results for the four models. Comparing their adjusted $R^2$, we can see that model contemporaneous correlation in (a) explains only a tiny fraction of the overall variation in the GDP growth rate, adjusted $R^2$ is 0.022. Using lagged terms instead increases the adjusted $R^2$ to 0.081, 0.196 and 0.239 in parts (b), (c), (d) respectively.

(a) (12.5 points) contemporaneous correlation model:  
$gRGDP_t = 3.132 + 0.081 rSP500_t + \varepsilon_t$

(b) (12.5 points) one-quarter leading indicator model:  
$gRGDP_t = 3.058 + 0.153 rSP500_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$

\begin{center} 
    \includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip, width=8cm]{figures/hw01q03_eq02.png}
\end{center}

(c) (12.5 points) four-quarter leading indicator model:  
$gRGDP_t = 2.694 + 0.138 rSP500_{t-1} + 0.148 rSP500_{t-2} + 0.061 rSP500_{t-3} + 0.062 rSP500_{t-4} + \varepsilon_t$

\end{center}

(d) (12.5 points) four-quarter indicator model with GDP inertia:  
$gRGDP_t = 2.068 + 0.122 rSP500_{t-1} + 0.119 rSP500_{t-2} + 0.027 rSP500_{t-3} + 0.046 rSP500_{t-4} + 0.230 gRGDP_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$
