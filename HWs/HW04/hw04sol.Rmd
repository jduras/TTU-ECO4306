## **Problem 1** 

<!--
Obtain the annual data for \underline{percentage change} in Per Capita Personal Income in Texas either from FRED or from Quandl. The time series in \underline{dollars} is available under code `TXPCPI` on [fred.stlouisfed.org](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) and under `FRED/TXPCPI ` on [www.quandl.com](https://www.quandl.com), so you either need to switch the units to percentage change directly on FRED and Quandl websites, or construct the percentage change in EViews yourself. 

(a) Change your sample to 1947-2010. Use this data to recreate the two panels in Figure 7.7, but for Texas 1947-2010 instead of California 1969-2002. 

(b) Compare your results in (a) with those in Figure 7.7. Based on the shape of AC and PAC, does the growth in per capita personal income in Texas follow a similar process as the growth in per capita personal income in California?

(c) Use AC and PAC functions from (a) to determine the order $p$ of the suitable AR($p$) model and estimate this AR($p$) model for the period 1947-2010.

(d) Use the model form (c) to create a forecast for period 2011-2015. Also generate the standard errors for this forecast and use it to construct the lower and upper bounds of the 95\% confidence interval for the forecast. Plot the actual data together with the forecast and its 95% confidence interval. 

(e) Comment on the accuracy of the forecast.

*Solution*

(a) The times series plot and the correlogram for real per capita personal income in Texas during the period 1947-2010 are shown below.

\end{center}

(b) The time series for real per capita personal income in Texas shows similar behavior as the real per capita personal income in California. The correlograms are also very similar -  AC decays toward zero gradually and PAC only has one significant component at lag 1.

\newpage

(c) For both California and Texas AR(1) model is appropriate since AC decays toward zero gradually and PAC only has one significant component at lag 1.

(d) Figure below shows the forecast for the period 2011-2015 together with its 95\% confidence interval and the actual values of the real per capita personal income growth in Texas.

\end{center}

(e) The actual values of the real per capita personal income growth in Texas are in the 95\% confidence interval for the forecast, but this interval is very wide, roughly from -2\% to 12\%. The forecast errors are -5\% between 3\%. The model forecast is thus not particularly precise.
