- Seasonal ARMA model 
  - Estimation
  - Forecast
  - Forecast Evaluation and Comparison with Naive Forecasting Method
- Conclusion



## Data

- monthly data for the Unemployment Rate in Lubbock County, TX 

- obtained from FRED database, see code [TXLUBB3URN](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TXLUBB3URN)

- sample: January 1990 to January 2019

\end{center}

- estimation sample: January 1990 to December 2013

- prediction sample: January 2014 to January 2019 



## Data

- first difference applied to obtain the change in the unemployment rate
$$
  y_t = \Delta UR_t = UR_t - UR_{t-1}
$$

- time series $y_t$ exhibits seasonal variation

    \includegraphics[trim=0.5cm 0cm -0.5cm 0cm, clip, width=9cm]{figures/hw07q01_txlubb3urn_fig01_ts.png}
\end{center}



## Data

- correlogram for change in unemployment rate $y_t = \Delta UR_t$ confirms the presence of a seasonal pattern

- large spike in PAC at lags 12 and 24, and large spikes at multiples of 12 in AC

\end{center}





## Estimated AR(1)-SARMA(1,1) Model

- multiplicative seasonal AR(1)-SARMA(1,1) model 
$$
    (1 - \phi_1 L) (1 - \phi_{12} L^{12}) y_t = \phi_0 + (1 + \theta_{12} L^{12}) \varepsilon_t
$$
- estimation results

    \includegraphics[trim=0cm 3.6cm 0cm 0cm, clip, width=5.5cm]{figures/hw07q01_txlubb3urn_fig03_eq1.png}
\end{center}
- estimated model thus takes the form
$$
    (1 + 0.098 L) (1 - 0.995 L^{12}) y_t = -0.004 + (1 - 0.789 L^{12}) \varepsilon_t
$$



## In-Sample Evaluation (Checking Model for Adequacy)

residuals of the estimated AR(1)-SARMA(1,1) model appear to be white noise

- time series plot does not show any recognizable pattern, or any changes in volatility over the estimation sample
- no remaining significant time dependence in correlogram

\end{center}



## Forecast based on AR(1)-SARMA(1,1) model

- sequence of one step ahead forecasts 

- prediction sample January 2014 to January 2019

- forecast tracks actual data quite well

\end{center}



## Forecast Evaluation - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

- simple naive forecast for the change in unemployment rate $f^{naive}_{t,1} = y_{t+1-12}$

- implied naive forecast for unemployment rate $\widehat{UR}^{naive}_{t,1} = UR_t + f^{naive}_{t,1}$

- forecast errors $e_{t+1} = y_{t+1} - f_{t,1}$

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[trim=0.5cm 0.5cm 0cm 0.5cm, clip, width=9cm]{figures/hw07q01_txlubb3urn_fig07_eq1_e.png}
\end{center}

- root mean squared error (RMSE)  
0.180 for forecast based on the AR(1)-SARMA(1,1) model  
0.221 for naive forecast



## Forecast Evaluation - Equal Predictive Ability Test

- test whether the difference in the precision of the two forecasts is statistically significant 

- hypothesis $H_0: \beta_0 = 0$ for the regression
$$
  \Delta L_{t,1} = \beta_0 + u_t
$$
where 
$$
  L_{t,1} = L(e_{t,1}^{SARMA}) - L(e_{t,1}^{naive})
$$
is the difference between the losses associated with the two alternative forecasts

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip, width=5.5cm]{figures/hw07q01_txlubb3urn_fig08_eq1_dl.png}
\end{center}

- since p-value for $\hat \beta_0$ is 0.0185 difference is indeed statistically significant at 5% level

- AR(1)-SARMA(1,1) thus produced a more precise forecast than the naive method



## Conclusion

- data for unemployment rate in Lubbock County is only available since 1990

- sample is thus relatively short

- seasonal ARMA model however performs quite well when applied to create the step ahead forecast for the unemployment rate

- estimated model outperforms the naive forecasting method, producing significantly more precise forecast
