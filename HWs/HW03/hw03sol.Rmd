## **Problem 1**

<!--	
The Federal Reserve Act of 1977 specified that the goals of the Fed are to promote stable prices and maximum employment. The maximum employment in this context is understood as the employment level such that the GDP is at its potential level. The high inflation in 1960s and 1970s then led the Fed under Paul Volcker, as Chairman of the Federal Reserve from August 1979 to August 1987, to focus on lowering the inflation. But since the inflation and GDP respond to monetary policy only with a lag, the Fed has to make decisions based on its forecasts of future inflation and  future GDP growth. The inevitable forecast errors are costly, which leads to the concept of the loss function we discussed in class. This problem will ask you to investigate some properties of the Fed's loss function for inflation forecats under Paul Volcker.

Download [hw03.csv]() which contains the quarterly time series for the inflation rate based on the GDP deflator and the real GDP growth rate during the Paul Volcker period, 1979Q4-1987Q3, both obtained from [research.stlouisfed.org](https://research.stlouisfed.org). In addition it also contains the 1-quarter-ahead forecasts for the two series, obtained from [www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/greenbook-data/philadelphia-data-set](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/greenbook-data/philadelphia-data-set).

Download the file [hw03.csv](http://myweb.ttu.edu/jduras/files/teaching/e4306/hw03.csv) which contains the quarterly time series `GPGDP` for the inflation rate based on the GDP deflator during the Paul Volcker period, 1979Q4-1987Q3, obtained from [research.stlouisfed.org](https://research.stlouisfed.org). In addition it also contains time series `GPGDP_F1`, Fed's 1-quarter-ahead forecasts for that inflation rate, obtained from [www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/greenbook-data/philadelphia-data-set](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/greenbook-data/philadelphia-data-set).

Note the time shift between the two variables: the *first* observation of `GPGDP_F1`, for 1979Q4, is the forecast in 1979Q4 of the inflation in 1980Q1, the actual value of which is the *second* observation of `GPGDP`, and so on.

\smallskip

(a) Create a time series plot showing together actual values `GPGDP` and 1-step ahead forecasts `GPGDP_F1(-1)`. Is there any trend? Does one time series appear to be above the other one most of the time?
(b) Generate 1-quarter-ahead forecast errors $e_{t,1}=y_{t+1}-f_{t,1}$ as `GPGDP_E1 = GPGDP - GPGDP_F1(-1)`. Create a time series plot for forecast errors. Do they appear to be distributed more or less symmetrically around zero, or are they positive or negative most of the time?
(c) Obtain histogram and descriptive statistics for forecast errors `GPGDP_E1`. Are they normally distributed? 
(d) Estimate the regression $e_{t,1} = \beta_0 + \varepsilon_t$ where $e_{t,1}$ is the 1-step-ahead forecast error, i.e. regress `GPGDP_E1` on constant only. Is $\hat \beta_0$ statistically significantly different from zero here?  Recall that under symmetric quadratic loss function forecast is unbiased, $f_{t,1} = \mu_{t+1|t}$ and $E(e_{t,1})=0$, which would imply $\hat \beta_0 = 0$. 
(e) Estimate the regression $y_{t+1} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 f_{t,1} + \varepsilon_{t+1}$ where $y_{t+1}$ is the actual value and $f_{t,1}$ is the 1-quarter-ahead forecast, i.e. regress `GPGDP` on constant and `GPGDP_F1(-1)`. Recall that under symmetric quadratic loss function the forecast is unbiased, $f_{t,1} = \mu_{t+1|t}$, and so in this case the regression would yield $\hat \beta_0 = 0$ and $\hat \beta_1 = 1$. Perform an F-test for the joint hypothesis $H_0: \beta_0=0, \beta_1=1$ to confirm/reject this.
(f) Obtain the correlogram for forecast errors. Do you observe any time dependence in the forecast error, or are the components of the AC and PAC functions within the 95% confidence interval around zero?
(f) If the forecast is optimal under symmetric quadratic loss function, $f_{t,1} = \mu_{t+1|t}$, and the forecast errors should be white noise with no time dependence, unbiased, with zero mean. Summarize the results from (a)-(e). Was the Fed under Paul Volcker producing forecasts which are optimal under the  assumption of a symmetric quadratic loss function, or is there some evidence that Fed's loss function was asymmetric?


*Solution*
-->


(a) Figure below shows the time series plot with actual inflation rate measured using GDP deflator, and the Fed's 1-step ahead forecasts for this inflation. There is a clear downward trend visible in the plot - inflation and its forecast dropped from around 11\% in early 1980s to around 2\% in late 1980s. During the 1979Q4-1987Q3 period the one quarter ahead forecast for inflation was consistently above the actual inflation.

(b) Figure below shows the time series plot for the one quarter ahead forecast errors. Consistent with our finding in (a) these errors are not distributed symmetrically around zero, instead they are negative most of the time.

\end{center}

(c) The histogram and the descriptive statistics for forecast errors shown below suggest that these forecast errors are normally distributed - skewness is close to 0, kurtosis close to 3; Jarque-Berra statistic is thus low and its p-value very high so we do not reject the hypothesis that forecast errors are normally distributed.

\end{center}

(d) Estimated coefficient $\hat \beta_0$ is highly statistically significantly different from zero - the p-value for the hypothesis $H_0: \beta_0=0$ is essentially zero. This provides a formal result for our insight from (b) that the forecast errors are not zero on average, $E(e_{t,1}) \neq 0$, but instead are negative.

\end{center}

(e) The results for the regression $y_{t+1} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 f_{t,1} + \varepsilon_{t+1}$ where $y_{t+1}$ is the actual value and $f_{t,1}$ is the 1-quarter-ahead forecast are below.

\end{center}

\newpage

The test statistic of F-test for the joint hypothesis $H_0: \beta_0=0, \beta_1=1$ is 17.79 and the associated p-value is essentially zero. We thus strongly reject the hypothesis at all conventional levels, which implies that the forecast is not unbiased.

(f) The components of the AC and PAC functions are within the 95% confidence interval around zero, so there does not appear to be any time dependence in the forecast error.

\end{center}

(g) Fed's forecasts for inflation during the period 1979Q4-1987Q3 do not appear to be optimal under symmetric quadratic loss function - forecast errors are a white noise with no time dependence as shown in (f), but they are not unbiased, with zero mean. They are instead negative on average, as shown in (a) and (b), and this bias is statistically significant, as documented in (d) and (e). Fed under Paul Volcker was producing forecasts which are more consistent with an asymmetric loss function, where under-predicting inflation is more costly that over-predicting it. This makes sense - if the Fed's primary goal in he 1980s was to bring down the inflation because it got too high in the late 1970s, it was optimal for Fed to set it's interest rate more aggressively. Actual future inflation lower than the forecast were then more acceptable than actual future inflation higher than the forecast.
